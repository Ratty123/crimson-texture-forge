## Redistribution Notes
 
- Crimson Forge Toolkit does not write back to `.pamt` or `.paz` archives.
- External tools such as `texconv.exe` and `chaiNNer.exe` remain separate projects and should be distributed in accordance with their upstream terms.
- If you publish releases of this app, review the upstream licenses of any bundled or redistributed third-party components before shipping them.
